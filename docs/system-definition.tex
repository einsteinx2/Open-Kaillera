Open Kaillera System Definition Document Version 0




\subsection{Document overview}

The main purpose of this document is to record agrements of various
 concepts, attributes, understanding and expectations of the system among
 developers. This is not a detailed specification of system requirements but
 rather an informal descriptive listing of agreed features. The selection of
 content that is included must satisfy that purpose.

This document is intended for current and future developers of open kaillera.


\subsection{System overview}

The purpose of the system
 - common multiplayer platform for emulators as well as applications such as small games who could make use of it
 - high performance
 - simple programming interface to abstract all networking code
 - open source
% This subclause briefy states the purpose of the proposed system or subsystem to which the ConOps applies. It
% describes the general nature of the system, and identfies the project sponsors, user agencies, development
% organizations, support agencies, certifiers or certifying bodies, and the operating centers or sites that will run the
% system. It also identifies other documents relevant to the present or proposed system.
% A graphical overview of the system is strongly recommended. This can be in the form of a context diagram, a top-level
% object diagram, or some other type of diagram that depicts the system and its environment.
% Documents that might be cited include, but are not limited to: the project authorization, relevant technical
% documentation, significant correspondence, documents concerning related projects, risk analysis reports, and
% feasibility studies.
